### Sofia Traffic Light Optimization (Svetlio)

**Project Overview:**  
Svetlio aims to enhance the flow and safety of vehicular traffic in Sofia by intelligently optimizing traffic light timings and providing real-time traffic light status to drivers through popular navigation apps. Utilizing advanced image recognition technologies, the system categorizes vehicles, monitors queue lengths at traffic lights, and recognizes eco stickers for a more sustainable urban mobility.

**Key Features:**

1. **Traffic Optimization:**
   - Monitors real-time queue lengths at traffic lights using camera surveillance.
   - Dynamically adjusts green light duration based on queue length, with a maximum cap (e.g., 2 minutes) to prevent excessive wait times for cross traffic.
   
2. **Vehicle Categorization:**
   - Utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) technology for real-time vehicle recognition and categorization (e.g., passenger cars, trucks, buses).

3. **Eco Sticker Recognition:**
   - Identifies vehicles' registration numbers to determine eco sticker compliance and potentially prioritize eco-friendly vehicles.

4. **Traffic Light Status on Navigation Apps:**
   - Develops a plugin for navigation apps (Google Maps, Waze) to display real-time traffic light status (green, red), enhancing route planning and reducing congestion.

**Objective:**  
To reduce traffic congestion, lower carbon emissions by prioritizing eco-friendly vehicles, and improve overall road safety in Sofia through smart traffic light management and integration with existing navigation technologies.

**Technologies:**  
- Image Recognition (YOLO for vehicle categorization)
- Real-time Data Processing and Analytics
- Plugin Development for Google Maps and Waze
